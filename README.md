# etf-analyzer

This repository has (or will have) a set of tools used to gather data related to ETFs and perform analysis to determine whether a certain allocation of ETFs constitutes a "good" investing portfolio.

Currently, there is one python script that pulls ETF allocation data from Zacks and inserts it into an sqlite database.
